       <h1>History of Germany</h1>
      
      <section>
        <h2>World War 1</h2>
        <p>
        The cause of WW1 was the ethnic demands for nation states upset the
        balance between the empires that dominated Europe, leading to World War
        I, which started in August 1914. Germany stood behind its ally Austria
        in a confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the protection of
        Russia, which was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the
        Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and
        later Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly
        of Russia, France, Britain, and in 1915 Italy.<br>In explaining why
        neutral Britain went to war with Germany, author Paul M. Kennedy
        recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more
        powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade
        imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern
        Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups.
        Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain
        increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially
        in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a
        profound moral crime. The German invasion of Belgium was not important
        because the British decision had already been made and the British were
        more concerned with the fate of France. Kennedy argues that by far the
        main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870 – when Prussia and
        the German states smashed France – would mean that Germany, with a
        powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest
        France. British policy makers insisted that would be a catastrophe for
        British security.

        <h2>Nazi Germany</h2>
        <p>
        Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, ruled the country from 1933 to
        1945, transforming it into a totalitarian dictatorship. The Third Reich,
        also known as the Thousand-Year Reich, claimed to be the successor to
        the Holy Roman Empire and German Empire. The regime was centered around
        Hitler, with power centralized in his person. During the Great
        Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass
        unemployment through heavy military spending. They seized Austria,
        demanded the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, and signed a
        non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Germany also invaded Poland
        in 1939, launching World War II in Europe. The regime's ideological
        features included racism, Nazi eugenics, anti-Slavism, and antisemitism.
        The Nazis considered the Germanic peoples the "master race," and Jews,
        Romani people, Slavs, homosexuals, liberals, socialists, communists,
        Jehovah's Witnesses, Freemasons, and other "undesirables" were
        imprisoned, deported, or murdered. The Nazi Propaganda Ministry
        controlled artistic expression and cultivated a pervasive cult around
        Adolf Hitler. The Nazis' failure to admit defeat led to massive
        destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths.
